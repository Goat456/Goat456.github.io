    	<h3>Boeing 737 MAX</h3> <p>  The Boeing 737 MAX was grounded worldwide after it experienced multiple crashes. After some investigations, it turned out that a faulty sensor had erroneously reported that the aircraft's engines had stalled, even though both of the engines were perfectly fine and working properly. The faulty sensor's alarm triggered an automated system known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS. This system tried to point the aircraftâ€™s nose down so that it could gain enough speed to fly safely. Gliding. </p>
<p> Here's an explanation: due to the the sensor's bad report, MCAS pointed the nose down, so with the engines running, the plane drove down into the ground.(You're gonna have to find your own video to watch, because I'm not posting any.)</p>><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2019/05/02/USATODAY/usatsports/aerospace-boeing-737-max-9-ba.jpg" height="200">

<h3>Boeing B-25 Mitchell</h3>
<p>The Boeing B-25 Mitchell is a medium bomber used during WW2. Its most notible mission was the Doolittle Raid, where it participated in the bombing of Japan. The B-25 was designed by North American Aviation, Inc., in response to a prewar requirement and was first flown in 1940. A high-wing monoplane with a double tail and tricycle landing gear, it is powered by two 1,700-horsepower Wright radial engines, had a wingspan of 67 feet 7 inches, was 53 feet 6 inches long, and carried a crew of four to six. The B-25 had a range of about 1,350 miles (depending on the weather and other variables), a maximum speed of about 300 miles (480 km) per hour, and a ceiling of 24,000 feet (7,300 metres). It could carry 3,000 pounds (1,360 kg) of bombs inside the plane in the bomb bay and more externally on underwing racks.</p>
